## Files descriptions
- Utilities: include support classes and functions.
- DataStructures: includes simple classes which their only responsibility is to store data and improve code readability.
- SEIH: contains the main class SEIH.
- matlab2python: contains the original code in MATLAB.

## Observations
- Most .py files will be paired with their corresponding test suite. **There is a sample use case in every test file**.
- Currently the main focus is correctness. Performance will be added later.

## Libraries
- Numpy, for numerical calculations.
- Pandas, for data management.

Is recommended to install the SciPy Stack with: `python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose`. See https://scipy.org/install.html.
