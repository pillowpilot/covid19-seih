Files descriptions
1. Utilities: include support classes and functions.
2. DataStructures: includes simple classes which their only responsibility is to store data and improve code readability.
3. SEIH: contains the main class SEIH.
4. matlab2python: contains the original code in MATLAB.

Observations:
1. Most .py files will be paired with their corresponding test suite.
2. Currently the main focus is correctness. Performance will be added later.

Libraries:
1. Numpy, for numerical calculations.
2. Pandas, for data management.
Is recommended to install the SciPy Stack with:
python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
